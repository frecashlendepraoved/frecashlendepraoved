Once you’ve chosen a lender, it’s time to apply. Applying for a personal loan includes filling out an application, usually online, with personal information like your Social Security number, address and contact details. You’ll also need to submit documentation, including proof of identity, employment and income.

If your application is approved, you’ll sign the loan agreement and receive funds typically within one week, though some lenders fund the same day you’re approved.
